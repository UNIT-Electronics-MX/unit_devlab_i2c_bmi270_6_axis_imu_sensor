# BMI270 Inertial Sensor Module

The **BMI270** is a `6 degrees of freedom (6DoF)` inertial sensor. It integrates a low-power accelerometer and high-performance gyroscope in a compact package, making it ideal for wearables, IoT devices, and motion detection systems.

This module is designed to work easily with microcontrollers, offering both **I2C** and **SPI** interfaces, along with configurable interrupt and auxiliary pins.

## Features

-  Low power consumption (ideal for battery-powered devices).
-  `16-bit` accelerometer and `16-bit` gyroscope.
-  `6-axis` sensing (acceleration + rotation).
-  Selectable `I2C` or `SPI` communication interface.
-  Configurable `interrupts` for motion, or gesture detection.
-  `Auxiliary` pins for extended use.
